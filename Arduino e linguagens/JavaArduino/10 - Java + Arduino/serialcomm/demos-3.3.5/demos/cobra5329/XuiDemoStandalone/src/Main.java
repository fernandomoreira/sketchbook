/**
 * <p>This demo is a technology preview of the also existing alternative 
 * more powerfull GUI, called JControl/XUI. The user interface handling 
 * is more abutted to menu driven and windowing concepts like Swing. It 
 * needs a little more memory consumption than Wombat, but looks very nice. 
 * Allmost all existing components are included in this demo, and also screen 
 * saver, user sophisticated designs, dragable windows and many more are supported.</p>
