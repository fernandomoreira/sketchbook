Locais que instalei e deu certo:


    Download 'RXTXcomm.jar' and install it in the 'lib/ext' folder of the Java VM (e.g. for Ubuntu 11.04: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre' and for RH9 with Sun's Java 1.6.0_04: '/usr/java/j2re1.6.0_04/lib/ext'). 
    You may need to download the file to a temporary location (e.g. Desktop) and use a privileged command (or sudo from the command/terminal) to move it to the destination.
     
    If you are upgrading from V 3.x or V4 Beta 2 (i.e. from an older version of RXTX), please remove the file 'librxtxSerial-2.1-x.so' in the '/lib/386' folder (or equivalent).
     
    Download 'librxtxSerial.so' and install it in the 'lib/i386' or 'lib/amd64' folder of the Java VM (e.g. for Ubuntu 11.04: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26/jre' and for RH9 with Sun's Java 1.6.0_04: '/usr/java/j2re1.6.0_04/lib/i386'). Try the 'bin' folder for this file if the 'lib/i386' is not found (e.g. for IBM's Java 1.4.x). Make sure that 'librxtxSerial' has execute permissions for all. You may need to download the file to a temporary location (e.g. Desktop) and use a privileged command (or sudo from the command/terminal) to move it to the destination.
     
    You may need to Log in as 'root' and add your jLog user to the group owning the '/var/lock' directory and the group owning the serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyS0) to be used. This is not needed for Ubuntu 11.04.

    This would typically (e.g. for Red Hat 9 and Fedora Core) be users 'lock' and 'uucp' respectively.
     
    Try running jLog as root if you experience problems, i.e. to find out if the problem is caused by improper access or improper installation of the files.

Depois de todo o processo d einstalação, a porta ACM0 fica indiponivel, então cria-se um link simbólico para ela:

ln -sf /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyUSB1
