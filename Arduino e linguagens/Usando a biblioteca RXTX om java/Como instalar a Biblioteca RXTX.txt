Using RXTX In Eclipse
From Rxtx
Jump to: navigation, search

This is how I add and use RXTX in Eclipse for Win32 Projects, there are probably other ways but it works for me. [1]

   1. Copy RXTXcomm.jar, rxtxSerial.dll and rxtxParallel.dll files to the lib directory of your project
   2. Under Project | Properties | Java Build Path | Libraries
   3. click Add JARs... Button
   4. Select the RXTXComm.jar from lib directory
   5. Jar should now be in the Build Path
   6. expand the RXTXComm.jar entry in the list and select "Native Library Location"
   7. Select the project lib directory and apply 

Be careful when using System.in.read() and rxtx in win32; It can trip across a known JRE deadlock bug

Alternative way:

The above setup didn't quite work for me, so here is an alternative.

   1. Copy RXTXcomm.jar to the lib directory of your project
   2. Navigate your package explorer to the lib folder, right click on RXTXcomm.jar | Build Path | Add to built path
   3. Copy rxtxSerial.dll and rxtxParallel.dll files to the root directory of your project
   4. Under Run | Run configurations | Classpath tab | User entries | Advanced | Add folder, choose the root folder of your project
   5. This should be enough just to run it under Eclipse, when deploying a runnable jar, just make sure the dlls are on the same folder as the jar (JVM assumes it for classpath)
